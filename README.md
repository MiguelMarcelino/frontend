# Contributing
Stocknear is open-source software and you're welcome to contribute to its development.

The core idea of stocknear shall always be: ***Simplicity***, ***Maintainable***, ***Readable*** & ***Fast*** in this order.

If want to contribute to the codebase please follow these guidelines:
- Reducing complexity and increasing readability is a huge plus!
- Anything you claim is a "speedup" must be benchmarked. In general, the goal is simplicity, so even if your PR makes things marginally faster, you have to consider the tradeoff with maintainablity and readablity.
- If your PR looks "complex", is a big diff, or adds lots of lines, it won't be reviewed or merged. Consider breaking it up into smaller PRs that are individually clear wins. A common pattern I see is prerequisite refactors before adding new functionality. If you can (cleanly) refactor to the point that the feature is a 3 line change, this is great, and something easy for us to review.
